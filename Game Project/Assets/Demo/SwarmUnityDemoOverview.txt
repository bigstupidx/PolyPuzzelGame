Important Notes:

1. The current version of the Swarm Unity Plugin is only for Android and it will not work on other platforms.
2. The current version of the Swarm Unity Plugin will only run on a physical Android device (won't work in the Unity Editor), because it relies on deeper parts of Android.


Description:

Each scene has a script of the same name attached to the main camera.

The LoginDemo scene has a single Login button that can be used to login to Swarm.  Upon successful login, the user will be taken to the main screen (aka HomeDemo scene). Note that the demo is configured to automatically log the user in (no credentials needed) after the first successful login.
 
The next scene is the HomeDemo scene. There are six buttons. The first implements the getUsername method. The middle four are used to switch to different scenes depending on the category of the feature they demonstrate. The last button runs the showDashboard method.

The AchievementDemo screen has 4 buttons. The top two buttons are the achievements for this demo. The third one implement showAchievements. The last button returns to the HomeDemo scene.

The LeaderboardsDemo screen has five buttons. The first two send scores using sumbitScore. The next two demonstrate showLeaderboard and showLeaderboards respectively. The last button returns to the HomeDemo scene.

The CloudDataDemo screen has 4 buttons. The first two send different data to the server. The third retrieves whatever data is on the server. The last button returns to the HomeDemo scene.

The StoreDemo screen has five buttons. The first one gets the quantity of whatever item you implemented. The second button will attempt to purchase the item. The third button will use the item. The fourth button implements showStore. The last button returns to the HomeDemo scene.
